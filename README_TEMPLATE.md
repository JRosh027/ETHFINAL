# Creata a Token

This Solidity program is a simple  program that demonstrates the basic mint and burn of the Solidity programming language. 
The purpose of this program is to have an Idea how to mint , burn and get the total supply.


## Description

This contract represents the minting, balance and burning capabilities of the Ethereum platform, 
We have included a conditional declaration to prevent burning out beyond the current token supply.



### Executing program
* To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

* To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar

* Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.

* After you click Deploy then scroll down and you will see "Deploy Contract" and click below the Deploy Contract

* Once you click it this will be the output:

* So to Try the contract , first we try to mint so will just need to copy the Account Address or just click the 2 page icon

* And then scroll down and click the arrow down icon to mint bar

* After that you will see the address and value bar, so paste the Account Address to the Address Bar and put any value to the Value Bar for example "1000" then click transact

* So After you click transact just scroll down a bit you will see the Total Supply Button you will see the output of what we input in value of mint

* And then if you want to Burn some token just repeat the Steps then viola, we got our Mint , Burn and Supply.
